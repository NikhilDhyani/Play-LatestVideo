### NOTE
    If you are having issue in opening video in vlc:
     1. firewall:  
        VLC is not allowed to access internet. So, just allow firewall to give access to VLC.
     2. If that's not working for you follow this link:  
        https://addons.videolan.org/content/show.php/+Youtube+playlist?content=149909  
      
    If you have a low speed internet connection play it on youtube because in vlc by default it plays the best quality available.
